# SmartLock-IoT

The Locker Security System is an Android app that uses IoT technology to enhance locker security. It detects intrusions using an ESP32 microcontroller, 
PIR sensor, and magnetic switches. When a breach occurs, it sends an alert to the user's phone and activates a buzzer. Future upgrades may include adding 
a camera to record and send images of intruders to the user. The app can also notify the police with the intruder's image.
